title: Creating a general formula for the nth derivative
description: Most calculus students are familiar with the Cauchy formula for repeated integration. What if there was a similar formula, but for differentiation?

While doing some taylor series calc homework, I got frustrated from differentiating the same exact functions over and over. I began to wonder if there was some sort of formula to do multiple differentations more quickly, but I couldn't find anything that worked for any function.

So, out of curiousity, I wrote down the formula for a difference quotient on my paper. 
$$ f'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to \infty} frac{f(x)-f(x+h)}{h}$$
